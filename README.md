## Section 1. Essentials

### 1.1. SFW Policy

This is a Safe for Work (SFW) environment. Not Safe for Work (NSFW) content and conversation is not allowed. Not Safe for Work (NSFW) content generally refers to sexually explicit content. However, with time, more things are getting labeled as NSFW due to the sensitivity of these topics. While Discord does provide the ability for servers to define NSFW dedicated channels,  does not provide such channels.

1.1.a - Do not share sexually explicit content in messages or media.

1.1.b - Do not post or hold sexually explicit content in user avatars, custom statuses, “About Me” texts, server banners, server icons, invite splashes, emoji, or stickers.

1.1.c - Do not share media depicting gore, excessive violence, or animal abuse.

1.1.d - Do not share content that glorifies, promotes, or normalizes suicide or other acts of self-harm. Self-harm acts or threats used as a form of emotional manipulation or coercion are also prohibited.

Examples of moderation expectations:

Mild: First offenses will get users brought into tickets and warned

Medium: Warns, tickets, and timeouts ranging from 1hr-12hours

Severe: Bans are to be expected at this stage

### 1.2. Concerns of Age

Discord’s minimum age for using their platform is 13. Assume everyone is of this age. Do not assume anyone’s age to be 18 or above by default. Do not use the server as a dating site or communicate using sexually charged undertones and language.

### 1.3. Respect Each Other

Respecting each other is by far our most important rule for this server.

Do not promote, coordinate, or engage in harassment. Discord is a platform where everyone can find a place to belong, and harassment prevents users from building healthy communities. We do not allow harassing behavior such as sustained bullying, doxxing, or raiding.

Do not use hate speech or engage in other hateful conduct. We consider hate speech to be any form of expression that either attacks other people or promotes hatred or violence against them based on their protected characteristics.

We consider the following to be protected characteristics: age; caste; color; disability; ethnicity; family responsibilities; gender; gender identity; housing status; national origin; race; refugee or immigration status; religious affiliation; serious illness; sex; sexual orientation; socioeconomic class and status; source of income; status as a victim of domestic violence, sexual violence, or stalking; and weight and size.

Do not threaten to harm another individual or group of people. This includes direct, indirect, and suggestive threats.

Do not organize, promote, or support violent extremism. This also includes glorifying violent events or the perpetrators of violent acts, as well as promoting conspiracy theories that could encourage or incite violence against others.

Examples of moderation expectations:

Mild: Pulling users into tickets and requesting that

Medium: Reprimand within tickets and timeouts ranging from 1hr-12hr

Severe:Severe or repeated offenses may result in bans.

### 1.4. Freedom of Speech, Controversial Discussion & Debates

Members are free to express themselves openly and give constructive criticism and feedback. We encourage free expression for all and embrace all of our differences, opinions, and diverse backgrounds.

While the Community promotes free expression, Members are encouraged to be cautious with sensitive topics and to engage constructively without promoting hatred, violence or other aggressive views.

If a discussion becomes overly heated and disruptive or “toxic”, the conversation may be stopped or suggested to finish via Moderator discretion.

_Examples of moderation expectations:_

Mild: Asking users to wrap up or end conversations

Medium: Forcing conversations to end.

Severe: If a user has repetitively offended they may receive timeouts and talked to in tickets within the matter of 5m to 2 hours.

### 1.5. Elitism

Members should refrain from insulting or belittling others based on what they use such as operating systems, desktop environments, and more; the same applies to all other interests a member might have outside of the primary topics of the server. While banter and “warring” is often a part of online communities, intentional and obnoxious elitism is not welcomed.

_Examples of moderation expectation:_

Mild: Occasional or every now and then is usually something that doesnt require active moderation

Medium: if a user is repetitively being rude or just isnt being healthyabout it, moderators may ask them to chill

Severe: If it becomes a problem, Moderators may pull members into tickets and respond accordingly based on their willingness to cooperate

### 1.6 Respecting Authority & Rules

* If a Moderator asks you to stop your behavior, listen to them. If you think something is in error, you can create a support ticket but please do not create more drama by dragging out Moderator actions publicly.
* Please refrain from back-seat moderating. Report rule breaking via ticket and let a Moderator resolve the situation.

## Section 2. Participation

* If you're unsure what a channel is for you can check the description for further details. If you're still confused you can ask in general chat, a Moderator or send in a ticket as a last resort.

## Section 3. Moderation

### 3.1. Reporting

Moderators are here to help. If there is a problem that needs Moderator attention, please create a ticket. Any and all problems are discussed as a group among Moderators. Remember nothing can be reported without concrete proof. Reporting because of rumors or hearsay is not acceptable proof. Please provide context, and searchable/linkable information as well as identifying information such as user IDs.

### 3.2. Consistency

All rules apply to all Members, including Moderators. If the Community has reason to believe the Owner is unfit for ownership due to breaching any rules defined in this document or misusing the server outside of what is listed, the Community may request for ownership to be removed and changed.

### 3.3. Transparency

Audit Logs are visible to all server Members. Audit Logs contain a history of all changes and actions within the server as well as all Moderator actions such as punishments given to Members.

### 3.4. Enforcement

Enforcement of these rules may be done through different means. Listed below are the typical forms.

#### Hard Rules

* TODO: What should be considered as an instantly bannable offense for this server?

#### Case by Case

WIth Case by Case moderation, punishment is more subjective and dependent on the nature and frequency of transgressions. While this system gives Moderators a large amount of flexibility, accountability can be difficult due to the lack of standards and certain Moderators may punish users differently. Because of this, all Moderator actions are free to audit and review and may require further agreement from the Moderation team.

#### Automod

Basic auto moderation will exist in this server to prevent universally severe and hateful/offensive language. If auto moderation prevents natural discussion at any point, report the issue via ticket. Additionally, basic safety and security precautions will exist to filter out harmful links and material shared within this server.

#### Mark System

* TBD: Decide if a mark system should be set in place for the server (e.g. 3 marks and you’re out)

### 3.5. Punishment

If a Member is found breaking any of these rules, Moderators reserve the right to give any of the following punishments depending on the severity of the offense:

* Warnings
  * Warnings act as a permanent history for Members and their behavior. Warnings should be descriptive and provide context or reason.
* Timeouts
  * TImeouts act as a temporary safeguard against in the moment disruption of the server and allow Members to “cool off” until they mitigate the current situation with a Moderator.
* Kicks
  * Kicks are typically not used within this server due to the way rule breaking is handled.
* Bans
  * Bans may either act as a temporary punishment for an allotted time frame based on the severity of the offense and the offender's history or as a permanent punishment if the Member breaks any of the server Hard Rules or has failed to show the ability to correct their behavior after a number of prior offenses.
    * TODO: Clarification is further needed on this topic.

#### Additional Actions

Additionally, Moderators reserve the right to:

* Delete any messages or posts with good reason.
* Change nicknames that violate our SFW policy or Discord ToS.
* Request for the change of any features found on a Member’s profile/server profile.
* Use their own discretion, but must justify these decisions and seek approval from their peers

### 3.6. Punishment Evasion

Members should not attempt to evade the consequences of their actions such as using an alternate account to bypass restrictions. Punishment evasion will result in an immediate ban.

### 3.7 Fairness

#### Bias

The rules defined in this document are to be reviewed and agreed upon by the Community as a whole. If a rule is unclear, it is to be revised until it is clear. If a Member believes that this document is missing any rules or exceptions, the Member may request for this addition to be reviewed and agreed upon by the Community.

In the event of a Moderator using personal best judgment when dealing with Members and punishments, all Members have the right to audit said actions and the Moderator should provide justification and or seek unanimous approval from the Moderation team.

#### Appeals

* If a Member believes their punishment is unfair, the Member can discuss their warning with the Moderation team via ticket.
* If a Member has been temporarily or permanently banned from the server and thus cannot create a ticket, the Member may reach out directly to the Moderation team for appeal.

TODO: Define an appeal process

* Add in appeals website

## Notice

Please understand that not every single rule can be listed here and that every situation requires context. Make sure to read every channel’s pinned messages for additional information and rules for that specific channel. Additionally, make sure to stay up to date with server announcements and polls for any changes to these rules.

Do not try to take advantage of 'loopholes' in the rules.

These guidelines will continue to evolve over time. This means we may take action against a user or content that violates the spirit of these guidelines when we encounter a new threat or harm that is not explicitly covered in the current version.

We will always make our best effort to notify you when we update these guidelines, but it is up to you to follow the spirit of them: keep Discord safe and a place for everyone to belong. Thanks for doing your part.

Most importantly: Use common sense and good judgment.
